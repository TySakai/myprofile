    <h4>SolPOD Test Results</h4>
</header>
<p>
    Over the course of five months I recorded the temperature of the air as it
    passed through the skirt of the SolPOD to see where the greatest heat loss
    was. Additionally I recorded the pre and post drying mass of the food that 
    to determine the effectiveness of the drying ability of the SolPOD.
</p>
<p>
    I found that there was a huge drop in tempeature as the air transfered from
    the skirt to the crown, most likely due to the drastic change in diameter. I 
    I also found that when given eight hours or more the slices of food would lose 
    around 30-50% of their mass. I concluded that although the SolPOD was able to 
    succesfully dry food put into it, if some changes were made to the crown greater 
    food drying could be acheived in less time.
