    The final calibration system was able to plot the entire temperature to color hue 
    curve of a section of LC. Using this system one would be able to find the exact 
    temperature that corresponds to an exact hue that the LC sheets show. This 
    calibration system would be used by students at Northeastern University for their 
    studies of fluid flows over various wing formations.
